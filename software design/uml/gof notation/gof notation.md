# GoF notation

Slanted type indicates that the class or operation is abstract.

An object reference representing a part-of or aggregation relationship is indicated by an arrowheaded line with adiamond at the base. The arrow points to the class that is aggregated (e.g., Shape). 

An arrowheaded line without the diamond denotes acquaintance (e.g., a LineShape keeps a reference to a Color object,which other shapes may share). A name for the reference may appearnear the base to distinguish it from other references.
