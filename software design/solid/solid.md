# SOLID

The SOLID design principles aim to:

* Make code more mantaibale.
* Makes code easier to read and understand.
* Make easier and quicker extending a system with new functionality without breaking exisiting ones.

The SOLID principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin in his 2000 paper [Design Principles and Design Patterns](Design%20Principles%20and%20Design%20Patterns.pdf).
