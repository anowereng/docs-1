# Single Responsibility Principle (CRP)

The principle states:

> A class should have only one reason to change.

What is a responsibility?

> In the context of the SRP, we define a responsibility to be "a reason for change".<sup>1</sup>

If an application is not changing in ways that casuse the two responsibilities to change at different times, then there is no need to separate them. It is not
wise to apply the SRP if there is no symptoms of possible change in the future.
