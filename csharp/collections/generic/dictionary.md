# Dictionary<TKey,TValue> Class

Each addition to the dictionary consists of a value and its associated key. Retrieving a value by using its key is very fast, close to O(1), because the `Dictionary<TKey,TValue>` class is implemented as a hash table.

The speed of retrieval depends on the quality of the hashing algorithm of the type specified for `TKey`.
