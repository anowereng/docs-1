# Attributes

Attributes provide a powerful method of associating metadata, or declarative information, with code (assemblies, types, methods, properties, and so forth). After an attribute is associated with a program entity, the attribute can be queried at run time by using a technique called [reflection](reflection.md).

Attributes have the following properties:

- Attributes add metadata to your program. *Metadata* is information about the types defined in a program.

- You can apply one or more attributes to entire assemblies, modules, or smaller program elements such as classes and properties.

- Attributes can accept arguments in the same way as methods and properties.

- Your program can examine its own metadata or the metadata in other programs by using reflection.
