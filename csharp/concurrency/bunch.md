# Bunch

Most servers have some parallelism built in; for example, ASP.NET will handle multiple requests in parallel. Writing parallel code on the server may still be useful in some situations (if you **know** that the number of concurrent users will always be low), but in general, parallel programming on the server would work against its built-in parallelism and therefore wouldnâ€™t provide any real benefit.

There are two forms of parallelism: **data parallelism** and **task parallelism**. Data parallelism is when you have a bunch of data items to process, and the processing of each piece of data is mostly independent from the other pieces. Task parallelism is when you have a pool of work to do, and each piece of work is mostly independent from the other pieces.

Regardless of the method you choose, one guideline stands out when doing parallel processing:

> The chunks of work should be as independent from one another as possible.

As long as your chunk of work is independent from all other chunks, you maximize your parallelism. As soon as you start sharing state between multiple threads, you have to synchronize access to that shared state, and your application becomes less parallel.
