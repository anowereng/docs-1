# Reflection

Reflection provides objects (of type `Type`) that describe assemblies, modules, and types. You can use reflection to dynamically create an instance of a type, bind the type to an existing object, or get the type from an existing object and invoke its methods or access its fields and properties. If you are using [attributes](attributes.md) in your code, reflection enables you to access them.
