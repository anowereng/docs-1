The systemctl may be used to introspect and control the state of the "systemd" system and service manager. 

### systemd

The **systemd** is the mother of all processes, responsible for bringing the Linux host up to a state where productive work can be done.

## Y

### YUM

The **YUM** is the Red Hat package manager that is able to query for information about available packages, fetch packages from repositories, install and uninstall them, and update an entire system to the latest available version. YUM performs automatic dependency resolution on packages you are updating, installing, or removing, and thus is able to automatically determine, fetch, and install all available dependent packages.
