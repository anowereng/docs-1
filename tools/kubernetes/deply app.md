# Deploy an app

Once you have a running Kubernetes cluster, you can deploy your containerized applications on top of it. To do so, you create a Kubernetes Deployment configuration. The Deployment instructs Kubernetes how to create and update instances of your application. Once you've created a Deployment, the Kubernetes master schedules the application instances included in that Deployment to run on individual Nodes in the cluster.

Once the application instances are created, a Kubernetes Deployment Controller continuously monitors those instances. If the Node hosting an instance goes down or is deleted, the Deployment controller replaces the instance with an instance on another Node in the cluster. This provides a self-healing mechanism to address machine failure or maintenance.

In a pre-orchestration world, installation scripts would often be used to start applications, but they did not allow recovery from machine failure.

You can create and manage a Deployment by using the Kubernetes command line interface, Kubectl. Kubectl uses the Kubernetes API to interact with the cluster.

When you create a Deployment, you'll need to specify the container image for your application and the number of replicas that you want to run. You can change that information later by updating your Deployment.

A Pod is the basic execution unit of a Kubernetes application. Each Pod represents a part of a workload that is running on your cluster.

## Deploy our app

Letâ€™s deploy our first app on Kubernetes:

```bash
kubectl create deployment kubernetes-bootcamp --image=gcr.io/google-samples/kubernetes-bootcamp:v1
```

You just deployed your first application by creating a deployment. This performed a few things for you:

* searched for a suitable node where an instance of the application could be run (we have only 1 available node)
* scheduled the application to run on that Node
* configured the cluster to reschedule the instance on a new Node when needed

To list your deployments run:

```bash
kubectl get deployments
```

We see that there is 1 deployment running a single instance of your app. The instance is running inside a Docker container on your node:

```text
NAME                  READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
kubernetes-bootcamp   1/1     1            1           15m
```

## View our app

Pods that are running inside Kubernetes are running on a private, isolated network. By default they are visible from other pods and services within the same kubernetes cluster, but not outside that network. When we use `kubectl`, we're interacting through an API endpoint to communicate with our application.

We will open a second terminal window to run the proxy:

```bash
kubectl proxy
```

We now have a connection between our host (the online terminal) and the Kubernetes cluster. The proxy enables direct access to the API from these terminals.

You can see all those APIs hosted through the proxy endpoint. For example, we can query the version directly through the API using the curl command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/version
```

Output:

```text

  "major": "1",
  "minor": "17",
  "gitVersion": "v1.17.3",
  "gitCommit": "06ad960bfd03b39c8310aaf92d1e7c12ce618213",
  "gitTreeState": "clean",
  "buildDate": "2020-02-11T18:07:13Z",
  "goVersion": "go1.13.6",
  "compiler": "gc",
  "platform": "linux/amd64"
}
```

The API server will automatically create an endpoint for each pod, based on the pod name, that is also accessible through the proxy.

First we need to get the Pod name, and we'll store in the environment variable POD_NAME:

```bash
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -o go-template --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}')
echo Name of the Pod: $POD_NAME
```

Output:

```text
Name of the Pod: kubernetes-bootcamp-69fbc6f4cf-jbfgc
```

In order for the new deployment to be accessible without using the Proxy, a Service is required.
