# Notation

Wherever we have a regular expression, you are going to see it inside forward slashes:

```text
/abc/
```

This notation with 2 forward slashes is a convention and it is used all the time. This convention comes back to `ed` editor where regular expression search was performed as:

```text
g/re/p
```

Ken Thompson implemented in 1968 regular expressions in `ed`, an early Unix text editor.
