## Config

Edit global `.gitconfig` file:

```bash
vim ~/.gitconfig # or use: git config --global --edit
```

Set default branch name:

```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch BRANCH_NAME
```

To see where that setting is defined (global, user, repo, etc...):

```bash
git config --list --show-origin
```

## Push to multiple repositories

```bash
git remote set-url --add --push origin https://gitlab.com/mialkin/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
git remote set-url --add --push origin https://github.com/mialkin/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
```

## .gitignore

| Line           | Description      |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| dir_to_ignore/ | Ignore directory |

## Naming commits

- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain _what_ and _why_ vs. _how_

## Fetching vs pulling

`git fetch` and `git pull` both are used to download new data from a remote repository.

### Fetching

`git fetch` really only downloads new data from a remote repository - but it doesn't integrate any of this new data into your working files:

```bash
git fetch origin
```

Fetch is great for getting a fresh view on all the things that happened in a remote repository.
Due to it's "harmless" nature, you can rest assured: fetch will never manipulate, destroy, or screw up anything. This means you can never fetch often enough.

### Pulling

`git pull`, in contrast, is used with a different goal in mind: to update your current HEAD branch with the latest changes from the remote server:

```bash
git pull origin master
```

This means that pull not only downloads new data; it also directly integrates it into your current working copy files.

Since "git pull" tries to merge remote changes with your local ones, a so-called "merge conflict" can occur. It's highly recommended to start a "git pull" only with a clean working copy. This means that you should not have any uncommitted local changes before you pull. Use Git's stash feature to save your local changes temporarily.
