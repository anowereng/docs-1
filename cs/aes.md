# AES

**AES** or **Advanced Encryption Standard** is a 128-bit symmetric *block cipher*.

**Block cipher** is something that takes a block of a certain size, let's say 128 bits, and turns it into an output or ciphertext of 128 bits.

**Rijndale** (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈrɛindaːl]), is an algorithm behind AES.

The nice thing about AES is that it's an *SP-network*.

**SP-networks** or **substitution–permutation networks** (**SPN**s) are the basis for a lot of modern cryptography — not all of it, but a lot of symmetric key cryptography anyway.
