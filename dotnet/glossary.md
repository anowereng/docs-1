### .NET Standard

The **.NET Standard**<sup>[1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard)</sup> is a formal specification of .NET APIs that are intended to be available on all .NET implementations. The motivation behind .NET Standard is to establish greater uniformity in the .NET ecosystem. The various .NET implementations target specific versions of .NET Standard.

NET Framework won't support .NET Standard 2.1 or later versions.
