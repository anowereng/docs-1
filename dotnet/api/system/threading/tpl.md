# Task Parallel Library (TPL)

The **Task Parallel Library** (**TPL**) is a set of public types and APIs in the `System.Threading` and `System.Threading.Tasks` namespaces.

Starting with the .NET Framework 4, the TPL is the preferred way to write multithreaded and parallel code.

Although the TPL simplifies multithreaded scenarios, we recommend that you have a basic understanding of threading concepts, for example, locks, deadlocks, and race conditions, so that you can use the TPL effectively.
