## Footnotes

<sup>1</sup> In most cases, you don't need to explicitly use the dotnet restore command, since a NuGet restore is run implicitly if necessary when you run the following commands:

```bash
dotnet new
dotnet build
dotnet build-server
dotnet run
dotnet test
dotnet publish
dotnet pack
```

<sup>2</sup> The command depends on the `dotnet build` command to build the code. Any requirements for the build, such as that the project must be restored first, apply to `dotnet run` as well.

The `dotnet run` command is used in the context of projects, not built assemblies. If you're trying to run a framework-dependent application DLL instead, you must use `dotnet` without a command:

```bash
dotnet myapp.dll
```

<sup>3</sup> The `dotnet test` command builds the solution and runs a test host application for each test project in the solution. The test host executes tests in the given project using a test framework, for example: MSTest, NUnit, or xUnit, and reports the success or failure of each test. If all tests are successful, the test runner returns `0` as an exit code; otherwise if any test fails, it returns `1`.
