# PowerShell

Windows has two command shells: **the Command shell** and **PowerShell**. Each shell is a software program that provides direct communication between you and the operating system or application, providing an environment to automate IT operations.

**Command Prompt** is one of the command-line interface programs used to execute commands in Windows operating systems.

PowerShell was designed to extend the capabilities of the Command shell to run PowerShell commands called _cmdlets_. Cmdlets are similar to Windows Commands but provide a more extensible scripting language. You can run Windows Commands and PowerShell cmdlets in Powershell, but the Command shell can only run Windows Commands and not PowerShell cmdlets.

> For the most robust, up-to-date Windows automation, we recommend using PowerShell instead of Windows Commands.
