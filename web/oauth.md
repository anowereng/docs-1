# OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect

## OAuth 2.0

**OAuth 2.0** is the protocol for authorization.

OAuth is commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.

Generally, OAuth provides clients a "secure delegated access" to server resources on behalf of a resource owner. It specifies a process for resource owners to authorize third-party access to their server resources without sharing their credentials. Designed specifically to work with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), OAuth essentially allows access tokens to be issued to third-party clients by an authorization server, with the approval of the resource owner. The third party then uses the access token to access the protected resources hosted by the resource server.

## OpenID Connect

**OpenID Connect** (**OIDC**) is an authentication layer on top of OAuth 2.0, an authorization framework.

OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which allows computing clients to verify the identity of an end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner.
