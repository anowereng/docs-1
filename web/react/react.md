# React

## Creating a new React app

[↑ Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

To create a project, run:

```bash
npx create-react-app dictionary-react && cd dictionary-react && npm start
```

To create an optimized build of your app, ready to deploy to production, in the `build` folder, run:

```bash
npm build
```
