# Getting started

## Create

[↑ Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

To create a project, run:

```bash
npx create-react-app dictionary-react && cd dictionary-react && npm start
```

## Run

To run the app in development mode, run:

```bash
nmp start
```

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code. You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

## Build

To create an optimized build of your app, ready to deploy to production, in the `build` folder, run:

```bash
npm run build
```
