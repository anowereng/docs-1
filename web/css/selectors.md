# CSS selectors

**CSS selectors** define the elements to which a set of CSS rules apply.

## Combinators

### > child combinator

The `>` combinator selects nodes that are direct children of the first element.

**Syntax:** `A > B`

**Example:** `ul > li` will match all `<li>` elements that are nested directly inside a `<ul>` element.
