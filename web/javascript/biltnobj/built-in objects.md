# Standard built-in objects

This chapter documents all of JavaScript's standard, built-in objects, including their methods and properties.

The term "global objects" (or standard built-in objects) here is not to be confused with **the global object**. Here, "global objects" refer to objects in the global scope.

Other objects in the global scope are either created by the user script or provided by the host application.
