# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes combines over 15 years of Google's experience running production workloads at scale with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.
