## Scrum

**Scrum** is an agile framework, an implementation of agile.

Plan -> Build -> Test -> Review. This proccess usually happens in period of time of 2â€“3 weeks and repeated many times.

You end up with several incremented releases called *sprints*.

**Sprint** is a 1 to 3 weeks timebox several incremented releases.

### Roles

There are 3 key roles in scrum that are needed to make framework work well:

- Product owner
- Scrum master
- Team

**Product owner** is a person who is responsible for defining the features that are needed in the product. Product owner has bright ideas that turn into products.

**Scrum master** is a servant leader of the team responsible for protecting the team and the proccess, running the meetings and keeping things going.

**Team** is a group of people that can be made of developers, testers, writers and anyone else that helps in building the product. Team members often play multiple roles: some days developers may end up doing tests or testers may end up writing. In either way the team is working on getting the product done.

### Artifacts

There are 3 artifacts:

- Product backlog
- Spring backlog
- Burndown chart

### Ceremonies

- Sprint planning
