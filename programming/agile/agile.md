## Scrum

**Scrum** is an agile framework, an implementation of agile.

Plan -> Build -> Test -> Review. This proccess usually happens in period of time of 2â€“3 weeks and repeated many times. You end up with several incremented releases called *sprints*.

**Sprint** is a 1 to 3 weeks timebox several incremented releases.

### Roles

There are 3 key roles in scrum that are needed to make framework work well:

- Product owner
- Scrum master
- Team

**Product owner** is a person who is responsible for defining the features that are needed in the product. Product owner has bright ideas that turn into products.

**Scrum master** is a servant leader of the team responsible for protecting the team and the proccess, running the meetings and keeping things going.

**Team** is a group of people that can be made of developers, testers, writers and anyone else that helps in building the product. Team members often play multiple roles: some days developers may end up doing tests or testers may end up writing. In either way the team is working on getting the product done.

### Artifacts

There are 3 artifacts:

- Product backlog
- Spring backlog
- Burndown chart

**Product backlog** is a place where product owners create a prioritized list of features known as *user stories* that could go into the product. This list evolves and changes priority with every sprint.

**User stories** are a way of describing a feature set that follows format:

- As a ...
- I need ...
- So that ...

This way of phrasing a user story allows the product owner to specify the right amount of detail for the team to estimate the size of the task.

**Sprint backlog** is a place where the highest priority user stories go. They get estimated for size and are commited to for the next sprint.

**Burndown chart** is a chart that shows the progress during the sprint on the completion of tasks in the sprint backlog. This chart should approach zero points as the work is being completed.

### Ceremonies

There are 3 ceremonies that make up scrum. Think of these as meetings or discussions:

- Sprint planning
- Daily scrum
- Sprint review

Where is **retrospective** in all of this?
