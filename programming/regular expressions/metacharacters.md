# Metacharacters

A **metacharacter** is a character that has special meaning. Metacharacters transform literal characters into powerful expressions:

```text
\ . * + - {} [] ^ $ | ? () : ! =
```

Metacharacters can have more than one meaning which depends on how they are used in context.

Metacharacters have variations between different regex engines.
