## S

### Shell

In computing, a shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.

Command-line shells require the user to be familiar with commands and their calling syntax, and to understand concepts about the shell-specific scripting language (for example, bash).

### systemctl

The **systemctl** is a controlling interface and inspection tool for service manager systemd.

### systemd

The **systemd** is the mother of all processes, responsible for bringing the Linux host up to a state where productive work can be done.

## Y

### YUM

The **YUM** is the Red Hat package manager that is able to query for information about available packages, fetch packages from repositories, install and uninstall them, and update an entire system to the latest available version. YUM performs automatic dependency resolution on packages you are updating, installing, or removing, and thus is able to automatically determine, fetch, and install all available dependent packages.
