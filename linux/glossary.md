### Shell

In computing, a shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.

Command-line shells require the user to be familiar with commands and their calling syntax, and to understand concepts about the shell-specific scripting language (for example, bash).

### systemctl

The **systemctl** is a controlling interface and inspection tool for service manager systemd.

### systemd

The **systemd** is the mother of all processes, responsible for bringing the Linux host up to a state where productive work can be done.
