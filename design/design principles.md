## SOLID

## DRY

The **DRY**, an acronym for “don't repeat yourself”, is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.

## KISS

The **KISS**, an acronym for “keep it simple, stupid”, is a design principle noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960.

The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.

## YAGNI

The **YAGNI**, an acronym for “You aren't gonna need it”, is a principle of extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary. XP co-founder Ron Jeffries has written: “Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.”

YAGNI is a principle behind the XP practice of ”do the simplest thing that could possibly work”. It is meant to be used in combination with several other practices, such as continuous refactoring, continuous automated unit testing, and continuous integration. Used without continuous refactoring, it could lead to disorganized code and massive rework, known as technical debt. YAGNI's dependency on supporting practices is part of the original definition of XP.
