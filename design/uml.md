## Stereotype

Graphically, a **stereotype** is rendered as a name enclosed by guillemets (« » or, if guillemets proper are unavailable, << >>) and placed above the name of another element. In addition or alternatively it may be indicated by a specific icon. Despite its appearance, «interface» is not a stereotype but a classifier.

## Classfifier

A **classifier** is a category of UML elements that have some common features, such as attributes or methods.

Examples of some predefined UML classifiers:

* Class
* Interface
* Use Case

Relationships between classifiers include generalization, association, implementation and various kinds of dependencies.
