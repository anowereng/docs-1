# Openâ€“closed principle

The principle states:

> Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.<sup>1</sup>

Principle means: we should write our modules so that they can be extended, without requiring them to be modified. In other words, we want to be able to change what the modules do, without changing the source code of the modules.

*OCP is achieved by using abstraction.*
